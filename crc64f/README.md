Fast non-reflected 64 bit CRC converted from example code from Intel to
work with Visual Studio, with comments added to explain what the RK..
constants represent.

crc64fa.asm - assembly code using pclulqdq

crc64fc.cpp - code to test crc64fa.asm

crc64fg.cpp - code to generate the RK.. constants used by crc64fa.asm
