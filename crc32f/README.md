Fast non-reflected 32 bit CRC converted from example code from Intel to
work with Visual Studio, with comments added to explain what the RK..
constants represent.

crc32fa.asm - assembly code using pclulqdq

crc32fc.cpp - code to test crc32fa.asm

crc32fg.cpp - code to generate the RK.. constants used by crc32fa.asm
